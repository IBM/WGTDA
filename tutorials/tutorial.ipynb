    "\n",
    "Weighted Gene TDA (WGTDA) was implemented to identify novel biomarkers in gene expression data. WGTDA provides a topological perspective on the organization of gene expression networks, further deciphering the complexity embedded in sequence-based gene expression data. Survival analyses and topological network graphs on the identified gene signatures of both frameworks can be conducted to validate and establish the clinical relevance and utility of WGTDA and to identify biomarkers that are important for disease progression.\n",
